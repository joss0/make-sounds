## Instructions!
> for some reason you must change the tuning before the oscillator starts working
+ SPACE to toggle the audio
+ A and S to change the pitch by an *Octave*
+ D and F to change the pitch by a *Semitone*
+ G and H to change the pitch by a *Quartertone*
+ Z and X to change the pitch by a *Tone*

## ToDo
- [ ] Polytonality
- [ ] A button to detune the oscillator by a random amount
- [ ] More Pretty
- [ ] Graphical controls
- [ ] A text field to set the oscillator tuning manually
- [ ] some other thing
